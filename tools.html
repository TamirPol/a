                    <p id="BandSaw"><span id="span1">A</span> bandsaw is a power saw with long sharp blade consisting of many metal teeth. 
                        The band saw is mainly used in woodworking and metalworking. 
                        The purpose of a band saw is to cut out shapes in wood, plastic, or metal.
                        One of its advantages over other saws is its ability to cut out irregular or curved sides and shapes.
                        <br><br><span id="span2">When </span>using the bandsaw it is important to keep your fingers at least 50mm away from the blade and stand in front of the blade.
                        Adjust the top of the blade approximately 6 mm above the material to be cut and always cut on the waste side of the line.
                        When removing small scrap pieces all use a wooden stick.

                        <span id="span4">When</span> using the disc sander remove all saw dust and only sand on dry wood.
                        Also always sand on the <i>rotating-down side surface</i> of the sander and never sand if the abrasive paper is loose or torn.
                        Keep your fingers at least four inches away from the sander and do not push the material too hard against the machine.
                        The wood must be positioned against the table at all times when using the machine.

                        Always use scrap piece of wood under the work to prevent damage to the drill press table and always brush the table with a shop brush.
                        Secure the drill bit in the chuck by placing the chuck key in one of the three holes and twisting firmly.
                        For a better finished cut, locate the center of a hole to be drilled with an X.
