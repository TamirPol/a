    <h1>BBQ Scraper</h1>
    <h2>My First Woodworking Project</h2>
    <p><span>There</span> has been some discussion over the past few years about the dangers of using metal-bristled brushes to clean barbeque grills as there has been incidents of metal wires falling into food.
        Because of this people have began to lean towards wood scrapers to clean their grills.
        This project is an example of a 2 by 6 inch wooden bbq scraper.
